# Crime Management System


CSE3001 Software Engineering Project.

The present world is technology driven as it is employed by many fields in the performance of their operation. In the case of law enforcement agencies, it is required to have a solid Crime management system to safeguard the rights of people and to maintain law and order in the country. Crime being an act against the law of a society is a threat to the well-being of the populace and so, requires efficient and effective monitoring. For this reason, Crime Management System has been developed to achieve this purpose.

Crime Management model requires a solid foundation of laws which should not be changed and are needed while making a software model. These laws ensure the law and order over the country and safeguard the rights of the citizens and also maintain the proper functioning at various workplaces. If these laws are bent or changed during its functioning it will lose its significant importance and will gradually increase the number of crimes all-round the country. These laws should not be changed. Hence the aim of the project is creating the Crime Management System.

Since while making of the above-mentioned project, various steps are involved which including Making of SRS Document, SDS Document along with Testing and Verification the output of the project can be used by any industrial professional to develop the software for the respective system as all the major documents that are required for developing the software are made. Hence, this project can be used by industrial professionals to implement this possible software system on a real-life scale.
